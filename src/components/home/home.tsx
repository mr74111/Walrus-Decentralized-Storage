                        Welcome to the Walrus Disk, a decentralized storage application that uses the Walrus
                        protocol to
                        store encrypted files. Walrus protocol focuses
                        on providing a robust but affordable solution for storing unstructured content on
                        decentralized
                        storage nodes while ensuring high availability and reliability even in the presence of
                        Byzantine
                        faults.

                        Walrus Disk uses javascript running within your web browser to encrypt and decrypt
                        files client-side, in-browser. This App makes no network connections during
                        this
                        process, to ensure that your keys never leave the web browser during
                        the
                        process.

                        All client-side cryptography is implemented using the Web Crypto API. Files
                        are encrypted using AES-CBC 256-bit symmetric encryption. The encryption key is
                        derived from the password and a random salt using PBKDF2 derivation with 10000
                        iterations of SHA256 hashing.

                        The encryption keys for all files are stored locally. If you change computers, use the
                        import/export function to migrate your keys to the new computer. If you don't do this, all
                        your
                        keys will be lost. Even the developer cannot recover your files.
